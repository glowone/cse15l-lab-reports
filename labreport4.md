**Keys pressed** 

``cd<space>lab7 <enter> `` , ``ls <enter> `` , ``bash test.sh <enter>``

Had to make sure I'm in the right directory before I demonstrate the test.

**Keys pressed** 

``vim<space>ListExamples.java <enter>``

``43x j`` (43x being the amount of times i pressed said key) 

``10x l``

``2x x``

then i fixed the wrong index code with 

``i``

``x2`` (im not precise in vim yet so i was 1 block off just replacing it with one keystroke.) 

``esc`` 

``<shift>:wq``

**Keys pressed** 

``git<enter>push<enter>myrepo<enter>main``

Originally git was trying to push these changes to the branch we were supposed to fork from, I had to declare the actual origin and then could push it. 

prompted to enter my username 

``glowone``

prompted to enter my password: 

``<password>``

:D

Just to clarify it again, I did the lab report after the lab so all the commands were written from scratch again instead of taking shortcuts. I am also pretty slow with following instructions so this whole thing took me an astounding 30 minutes, whilst recording my keystrokes and updating the lab as I'm going on.
